Script(s?) to mess with devolo powerline adapters
=================================================

Only contains a script to decrypt the config file you can download from the web interface.
They append a checksum at the end I haven't reversed yet, so it's not possible to edit the config files yet. Just to view.

In root.md you can find instructions to root the dLAN 500 WiFi on firmware 2.0.4. I was not able to test different devices.
